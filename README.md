# AI_Diabetes_Prediction

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence has officially become one of the biggest computer science fields used in our day to day life. And our project is one of many examples that represent the great utility of AI :Diabetes Prediction, all i needed in this project is finding the fittest accurracy for more precise and accurate results.
Here is a sneak peak of the used tools and observations.

## Used tools 
### 1.Jupyter

Jupyter is one of the open source web-application that allows data-scientists to write kind of every type of codes (from maths to AI and in between)

### 2.python

Python is an environment for coders and codeing language, it also gives space for libraries importations such as tensorflow, numpy..etc

### 3.Numpy

Numpy is a library that offers numerous mathematical tools (matrix, tabs..etc)

### 4.tensorflow

Tensorflow offers tools to study data and represent it with different techniques, it's widely used in deep learning to work with layers

### 5.Scikit learn

Scikit learn offers very advanced models for representing dataframes, it allows us to work with classification algorithms,SVMs and Random Forest representation.

## GUI Form

Here the user enters all his medical data, and then he can visualize the result with the both deep and machine learning algorithms

in this picture, i tried to implement an exception code to make sure that the user has entered all the necessary inputs, in order not to impact the final prediction.
