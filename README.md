# AI_Diabetes_Prediction

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence has officially become one of the biggest computer science fields used in our day to day life. And our project is one of many examples that represent the great utility of AI :Diabetes Prediction, all i needed in this project is finding the fittest accurracy for more precise and accurate results.
Here is a sneak peak of the used tools and observations.

## Used tools 
### 1.Jupyter

Jupyter is one of the open source web-application that allows data-scientists to write kind of every type of codes (from maths to AI and in between)

### 2.python

Python is an environment for coders and codeing language, it also gives space for libraries importations such as tensorflow, numpy..etc

### 3.Numpy
